# Mod 3 Project Instructions


## Congratulations! 

You have made it half way through the course work!

## The Project
**The goal of this project is to test your ability to gather information from a real-world database and 
use your knowledge of statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to generate analytical insights that 
are valuable.**

## Data Source
- For this project, you may work with the Northwind database--a free, open-source dataset created by Microsoft 
containing data from a fictional company. You probably remember the Northwind database from our section on Advanced SQL. 
Here's the schema for the Northwind database:
[Schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-mod-3-project/master/Northwind_ERD_updated.png)
- You can also use data of your own finding that is interesting. Ideally, the data should be in the form of a database, but please find a data set that will lead to interesting hypotheses(questions).

## Deliverables
- Your team must prepare a 5-10 minute presentation detailing the statistical analysis performed. 
- Be sure to specify both the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. 
- You should also specify if your hypothesis is a one-tail or a two-tail test.
- Specify the statistical test used to reach your conclusions
- Your presentation must provide at least three hypotheses(questions) and outline the process you went through to test the hypotheses. 
- Use at least 4 meaningful data visualizations to help illustrate your findings. 
- Any additional statistial analysis used to reach conclusions(Power, sample size, effect size, sampling, and other statistical 
analysis)
- No more than 8 slides.

Be prepared to answer questions such as:
- "why did you select your data?"
- "why did you pick the question(s)?"
- "why are these questions important?"
- "What are type I and II errors associated with your hypotheses?" 
- "how did you decide on the statistical analysis carried out by your group and what did you learn from them?"
- "how did you decide on the data cleaning options you performed?"
- "why did you choose a given method or library?"
- "why did you select those visualizations and what did you learn from each of them?"

## Project Checklist:

 - [ ] Use the data provided or one of your own
   - [ ] Establish naming conventions for variables and datasets
   - [ ] Clean dataset
     - [ ] You may use Pandas or Python functions
     - [ ] Document your data cleaning process
 - [ ] Use **Scipy and/or Statsmodels** perform meaningful statistial analysis on your data set. You may also use your own or prewritten functions.
     - [ ] Carry out **at least three** hypothesis test using the statistical test from lectures and learn.co (ANOVA, t-test, etc).
     - [ ] Carry out any further statistical analysis such as power analysis, sampling, effect size, etc.
 - [ ] Posted to git repository:
   - [ ] A README.md listing project members, goals, responsibilities, and a summary of the files in the repository
   - [ ] At least 10 commits
     - [ ] Must include short, descriptive commit messages
     - [ ] Each project member should commit at least once
   - [ ] A Jupyter notebook targeted to a technical audience that contains
     - [ ] Clean and commented code so an independent party can replicate your analysis and justify your analytical choices
     - [ ] Your final joined and cleaned dataset that was used for analysis.
     - [ ] The packages or methods used to perform stastistical analysis.
   - [ ] A narrative Jupyter notebook targeted to a non-technical audience that provides:
     - [ ] The purpose of your analysis and why it matters
     - [ ] 4 well annotated visualizations
     - [ ] Statement of your hypotheses and conclusions 
   - [ ] A pdf of 8 - 10 slides used in a presentation targeting non-technical audience
     - [ ] Apply consistent and effective formatting to create a “professional” appearance
     - [ ] Write an abbreviated high-level overview of methodology and statistical analysis performed
     - [ ] Present **at least 3** hypotheses and concrete recommendations from conclusions drawn from hypothesis testing
     - [ ] include exported visualizations from analysis
     - [ ] Target the presentation to a non-technical audience, avoid jargon
     - [ ] Take 5 - 10 minutes to present

### Project Review
If any requirements are missing or if significant gaps in understanding are uncovered, be prepared to do one or all of the following:
 - Perform additional data cleanup, data visualization, and statistical analysis 
 - Submit an improved version
 - Meet again for another Project Presentation
 
What won't happen:
 - You won't be yelled at, belittled, or scolded
 - You won't be put on the spot without support
 - There's nothing you can do to instantly blow it
