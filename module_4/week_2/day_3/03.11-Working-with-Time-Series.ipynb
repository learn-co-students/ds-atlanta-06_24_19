    "Date and time data comes in a few flavors, which we will discuss here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Time stamps* reference particular moments in time (e.g., July 4th, 2015 at 7:00am).\n",
    "- *Time intervals* and *periods* reference a length of time between a particular beginning and end point; for example, the year 2015. Periods usually reference a special case of time intervals in which each interval is of uniform length and does not overlap (e.g., 24 hour-long periods comprising days).\n",
    "- *Time deltas* or *durations* reference an exact length of time (e.g., a duration of 22.56 seconds).\n",

    "In this section, we will introduce how to work with each of these types of date/time data in Pandas.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Resampling involves changing the frequency of your time series observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two types of resampling are:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Upsampling: Where you increase the frequency of the samples, such as from minutes to seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Downsampling: Where you decrease the frequency of the samples, such as from days to months.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common need for time series data is resampling at a higher or lower frequency.\n",
    "This can be done using the ``resample()`` method, or the much simpler ``asfreq()`` method.\n",
    "The primary difference between the two is that ``resample()`` is fundamentally a *data aggregation*, while ``asfreq()`` is fundamentally a *data selection*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking a look at the Google closing price, let's compare what the two return when we down-sample the data.\n",
    "Here we will resample the data at the end of business year:"
